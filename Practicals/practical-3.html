    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Full stack web development is the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end of a program. It is a term mostly used for those working in web development. The developers have background on creating user interface and user experience for front-end, and also have strong knowledge in a programming language that is used for handling the logic of the application, hence back-end.</p>
